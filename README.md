# Playing with Event Sourcing architecture

## Project goals:
- Play with the concept of Event Sourcing
- Play with Event Store DB
- Have a Domain without the "Apply" method that does not "feel natural" to Domain, and pushing this concept to the Application layer
- Creating events subscriptions to project Read Models from event stream
  - Use Elastic Search as the Read Model persistence

This is work-in-progress still and as I learn/experience more things I will push them here
